 * head and tail only increment; modulo is applied when indexing:

 * Unsigned arithmetic correctness:
 *   head and tail are unsigned int (32-bit).  They increment without

 *   well-defined by C unsigned wraparound: even after 2^32 increments,

 *   2^32.  The modulo index (head % RING_SIZE) maps naturally because
 *   RING_SIZE is a power of 2, making % equivalent to a bitmask.
 *
 * This avoids the classic "is the ring full or empty?" ambiguity of
