 * dmaplane main.c — Character device driver, ioctl dispatch, and mmap
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Graziano Labs Corp.
 *
 * This is the entry point for the dmaplane kernel module.  It registers
 * a platform device for DMA operations, a character device at
 * /dev/dmaplane, dispatches ioctls to per-command handlers, provides
 * mmap support for DMA buffers, and manages per-file context.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   userspace ioctl → dmaplane_ioctl (this file) → handler functions
 *   Each open fd gets a dmaplane_file_ctx.  Channel creation spawns a
 *   kthread that drains the submission ring and fills the completion ring.
 *   Buffer management is a separate subsystem (dmabuf_rdma.c) — buffers
 *   are global resources, not per-channel.  mmap maps DMA buffer pages
 *   directly into userspace for zero-copy I/O.
 *
 * Data flow (channels):
 *   userspace --[IOCTL_SUBMIT]--> sub_ring --[worker]--> comp_ring
 *             <--[IOCTL_COMPLETE]--
 *
 * Data flow (buffers):
 *   userspace --[IOCTL_CREATE_BUFFER]--> dmabuf_rdma_create_buffer
 *   userspace --[mmap]--> dmaplane_mmap --> vm_insert_page / dma_mmap_coherent
 *
 * Locking summary:
 *   dev_mutex (struct mutex)
 *     Protects: channel slot allocation and deallocation in
 *               dma_dev->channels[].
 *     Acquired by: dmaplane_ioctl_create_channel, dmaplane_release,
 *                  dmaplane_exit.
 *     Why mutex: only taken in process/ioctl context where sleeping is
 *                permitted; never on the submit/complete hot path.
 *     Ordering: outermost lock.  Independent of buf_lock.
 *
 *   buf_lock (struct mutex)
 *     Protects: buffer array, slot allocation, mmap lookups.
 *     Acquired by: buffer ioctl handlers, dmaplane_mmap.
 *     Why mutex: sleeping context OK — only from process context.
 *     Ordering: independent of dev_mutex (never nested).
 *
 *   channel->lock (struct mutex)
 *     Protects: channel state (shutdown flag, worker pointer).
 *     Acquired by: dmaplane_release (shutdown sequence).
 *     Why mutex: sleeping context OK — only from process context.
 *     Ordering: dev_mutex → channel->lock → ring spinlocks.
 *
 *   sub_ring.lock / comp_ring.lock (spinlock_t, irqsave)
 *     Protects: ring entries[] array and head/tail index updates for
 *               the respective ring.
 *     Acquired by: ioctl submit/complete paths (producer or consumer)
 *                  and the worker thread (the other side).
 *     Why spinlock: ring operations are very short and may be called
 *                   from contexts where sleeping is not desired.
 *     Ordering: never nested; each ring lock is independent.
 *
 * Memory ordering:
 *   smp_store_release() is used on every head/tail advancement to
 *   ensure that the entry write (or read) is visible to the other side
 *   before the index update becomes visible.  The matching acquire
 *   semantics are provided by spin_lock_irqsave() on the consumer/
 *   producer side.  This is a no-op on x86 (TSO) but required for
 *   correctness on ARM and RISC-V.

 * Locking:
 *   Acquires sub_ring.lock (consumer side) to read submissions and

 *
 * Backpressure:
 *   If the completion ring is full, the worker yields via cond_resched()
 *   in a spin-wait loop rather than dropping entries.  This applies
 *   backpressure upstream: the submission ring fills, and userspace
 *   gets -ENOSPC on the next submit, forcing it to drain completions.
 *
 * Shutdown:
 *   The outer loop checks kthread_should_stop().  The wait_event also
 *   checks kthread_should_stop() so the worker wakes up on stop.
 *   The completion ring yield loop additionally checks kthread_should_stop()
